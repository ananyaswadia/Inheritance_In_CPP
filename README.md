# Inheritance_In_CPP
## Aim
To study and implement INHERITANCE in C++.
## Theory
The capability of a class to derive properties and characteristics from another class is called Inheritance. Inheritance is one of the most important features of Object-Oriented Programming in C++. In this article, we will learn about inheritance in C++, its modes and types along with the information about how it affects different properties of the class.

Types Of Inheritance in C++
The inheritance can be classified on the basis of the relationship between the derived class and the base class. In C++, we have 5 types of inheritances:
1. Single inheritance
2. Multilevel inheritance
3. Multiple inheritance
4. Hierarchical inheritance
5. Hybrid inheritance
## Algorithms
### Single Level
### Multi Level
### Hierarchical
